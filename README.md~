# Star=CD Addons (Profe Macros and Macro Dependencies)

These Star-CD(profe module) macros are intended to be called from Star-CD v2.6 environment.

The following is a brief description for each macro:


## Divc

Macro name: divc2d.MAC
Dependency: divc.exe

Splits a layer of structured 2d mesh into two so that each layer is also structured. 

The code is only intended to work with the profe macro divc2d.MAC.


## BendOverCylinder

Macro name: divc2d.MAC
Dependency: divc.exe

Transforms the selected nodes so that they bend over a pipe with outside radius R. 

This operation preserves the volume.


## Jacobian

Macro name: Jacobian.MAC
Dependency: Jacobian.py

Transforms the selected nodes so that they bend over a pipe with outside radius R.
